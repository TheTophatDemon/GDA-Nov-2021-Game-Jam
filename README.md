A platformer starring a big dork who wants to collect coins.
But, each coin summons an evil flying shadow clone that will chase him.
Collect all 7 coins to win, or die.

Controls:

Arrow keys - Move

Z or Up - Jump

Running against walls will cause the player to slide down, and pressing
jump at such a moment will do a wall jump.

Made in the span of 1 week using Godot 3.3.1
